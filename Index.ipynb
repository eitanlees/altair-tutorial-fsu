    "\n",
    "We'll start with a set of intro slides, followed by a live-coded demo of what it looks like to explore data with Altair.\n",

    "\n",
    "This will cover a lot of ground very quickly. Don't worry if you feel a bit shaky on some of the concepts; the goal here is a birds-eye overview, and we'll walk-through important concepts in more detail later.\n",
